# Race Day

The annual race is just around the corner.

## Introduction

We will write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on the race day.

---

Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race Number:

- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
- All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

- Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
- Early adults run at 9:30 am.
- Late adults run at 11:00 am.
- Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
